# KNN-Based Movie Recommendation System  

This repository contains a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Movie Recommendation System** using **Cosine Similarity**. The system analyzes users with similiar movie watching history and recommends movies.  

## üìå What This Code Does  

1. **Loads a CSV file** containing user movie preferences.  
2. **Encodes movies seen** into binary vectors using **one-hot encoding**.  
3. **Computes Cosine Similarity** between users' viewed movies to find the closest matches.  
4. **Finds the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for each user based on similarity scores.  
5. **Recommends movies** that similar users have watched but the target user hasn‚Äôt.  
6. **Outputs recommendations** with the most similar user(s) and movies to watch.
